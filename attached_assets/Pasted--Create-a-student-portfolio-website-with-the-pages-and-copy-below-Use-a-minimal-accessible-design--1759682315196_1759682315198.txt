2) ABOUT

Section: My why
Ant colonies taught me the beauty of routine and robust systems. I apply that lens to engineering: quiet, reliable tools that make daily life simpler for those who are excluded by default settings.

Section: Today
IB Diploma (Math AA HL, Physics HL, Economics HL). Building assistive interfaces and sustainable systems — from SoulSound to a multi-language Braille translator — and documenting results with real users.

Section: Tomorrow
At university, I hope to explore embedded systems, low-power ML, and human-computer interaction for accessibility. I want my work in the lab to travel to clinics, classrooms, and crowded public spaces.

3) PROJECTS

(Each project is a card with: title, 1-line pitch, 4–6 line summary, skills/stack, links.)

Project 1: SoulSound (Assistive Communication Device)
Pitch: Quick, context-aware phrase selection for speech/hearing-impaired users.
Summary: I designed an interface that surfaces likely phrases in public settings (transport, clinics, shops), reducing taps to communicate essentials. Conducted field feedback with Sarthak NGO members and iterated for clarity, iconography, and offline reliability.
Skills/Stack: UI/UX, embedded/edge logic (if applicable), accessibility heuristics, user testing.
Links: [Demo/Video] [GitHub] [Poster/PDF]

Project 2: Bharati Braille Translator (Multi-Language)
Pitch: Converts English, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, and Bengali text to Bharati Braille.
Summary: A modular pipeline for accurate transliteration and line-breaking suited to tactile output. Designed for screen reader compatibility and future Braille printer integration. Emphasis on error surfacing and language-specific rules.
Skills/Stack: Python, text processing, data validation, i18n.
Links: [GitHub] [Docs] [Demo]

Project 3: Autonomous Waste Recycling Robot — Review + Proposal
Pitch: Survey of sensing, grasping, and sorting approaches for urban recycling.
Summary: Authored a structured review with a concept design using sensors, vacuum pre-sort, and a lightweight arm. Presented at SRS Bulgaria 2024 with feedback from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
Skills: Literature review, system design, robotics fundamentals.
Links: [Slides/Paper] [Conference]

Project 4: Integrated Health Solution (YTS Plaksha)
Pitch: Modular vitals package with ECG, temperature, and SpO₂.
Summary: Built and tested a simple, low-cost health platform emphasizing interpretability and safe ranges, with a path toward school/clinic demos.
Skills: Sensors, signal basics, prototyping.
Links: [Poster] [Repo]

Project 5: Exoplanet Simulator (Unity)
Pitch: Educational visualization of orbital dynamics.
Summary: Simulates multi-body systems with adjustable parameters for classroom use.
Skills: Unity, physics modeling, UI for learnability.
Links: [Demo] [Repo]

4) RESEARCH

Published:

AI-Based Data Augmentation for Small, Imbalanced Datasets — Curieux Academic Journal (2025). Compared CNNs (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, YOLO variants) and augmentation strategies to stabilize accuracy on limited data.

Conference / Talks:

SRS Bulgaria 2024 — Robotics in Waste Sorting: Scope & Challenges. Presented a review and a concept proposal; Q&A on sensors, cost, and throughput.

Mentors & Collaboration:

Dr. CVS Kiran (Skyroot Aerospace): Feedback on clarity and technical rigor.

Ivan Dimitrov (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences): Guidance on review structure.

Research meta description: Journal publication, conference presentation, mentors, and ongoing studies in accessible engineering.

5) LEADERSHIP & SERVICE

Vice Head of Service — Pathways Student Council
Led earthquake-relief bake sales, a climate-action committee, and the “Leisure Time” pilot that safely opened outdoor spaces during breaks. Coordinated volunteers, logistics, and outreach.

Community Projects:

SoulSound x Sarthak: Iterative testing and feedback loops with community members.

Bharati Braille Translator: Advocacy for multilingual literacy and tactile accessibility.

Reflection (short):
Leadership means shipping helpful systems and staying reachable for feedback. Service is part of the engineering spec — not an afterthought.
